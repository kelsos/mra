Manga Reading Assistant
=======================

This is an attempt to port a previous [project](https://github.com/kelsos/mra-net-sharp) from C# and .NET to something multiplatform using C++.

I initial started with wxWidgets and a few libraries (including libxml2) and then I moved to Qt after finding it more feature complete.

The initial project started as a VB.net project while studying for a class. The code is probally really awful.
